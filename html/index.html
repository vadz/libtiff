<P>
This software provides support for the <I>Tag Image File Format</I> (TIFF),
a widely used format for storing image data.  The latest version of
the TIFF specification is <A HREF=document.html>available on-line</A>
in several different formats,
as are a number of <A HREF= http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/technotes.html>TIFF Technical Notes (TTN's)</A>.

<P>
Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems,
and documentation on the library and
tools.  A small assortment of TIFF-related software for UNIX
that has been contributed by others is also included.

<P>
The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of
your needs for reading and writing TIFF images on 32- and 64-bit
machines.  This software can also be used on older 16-bit systems
though it may require some effort and you may need to leave out some of
the compression support.

<p> The software was orginally authored and maintained by Sam Leffler.
While he keeps a fatherly eye on the mailing list, he is no longer
responsible for day to day maintenance. 

<p> Questions should be sent to
the TIFF mailing list: <A

<p> The person responsible for putting up this site and putting together version 3.5.1 is <A
