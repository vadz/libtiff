This software is free.  The only thing that I ask in return is that you
tell me when you find a problem or fix a bug.  I also gladly accept
software contributions, although I hesitate to include such software in
my regular stuff if I am personally unable to test it.

<P>
A mailing list for users of this software is located on sgi.com.
If you want to join this mailing list or have a list-related request
such as getting your name removed from it, send a request to

For example, to subscribe, send the line
