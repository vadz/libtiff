.SH NAME
tiff2pdf - convert a TIFF image to a PDF document
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tiff2pdf [
.I options 
.B ] 
.I input.tiff
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tiff2pdf
opens a TIFF image and writes a PDF document to standard output.
.PP
The program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file, including multiple page 
TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black and white. grayscale, and color TIFF 
files that contain data of TIFF photometric interpretations of bilevel, 
grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as supported by 
.B libtiff 
and PDF.
.PP
If you have multiple TIFF files to convert into one PDF file then use 
.B tiffcp 
or other program to concatenate the files into a multiple page TIFF file.  
If the input TIFF file is of huge dimensions (greater than 10000 pixels height
or width) convert the input image to a tiled TIFF if it is not already.
.PP
The standard output is standard output.  Set the output file name with the 
"-o output.pdf" option.
.PP
All black and white files are compressed into a single strip CCITT G4 Fax 
compressed PDF, unless tiled, where tiled black and white images are 
compressed into tiled CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, 
.B libtiff 
CCITT support is assumed.
.PP
Color and grayscale data can be compressed using either JPEG compression, 
ITU-T T.81, or Zip/Deflate LZ77 compression.  Set 
the compression type using the -j or -z options.  JPEG compression support 
requires that 
.B libtiff 
be configured with JPEG support, and Zip/Deflate 
compression support requires that 
.B libtiff 
be configured with Zip support, 
in tiffconf.h.  Use only one or the other of -j and -z.
.PP
If the input TIFF contains single strip CCITT G4 Fax compressed information, 
then that is written to the PDF file without transcoding, unless the options 
of no compression and no passthrough are set, -d and -n.
.PP
If the input TIFF contains JPEG or single strip Zip/Deflate compressed 
information, and they are configured, then that is written to the PDF file 
without transcoding, unless the options of no compression and no passthrough 
are set.
.PP
The default page size upon which the TIFF image is placed is determined by 
the resolution and extent of the image data.  Default values for the TIFF 
image resolution can be set using the -x and -y options.  The page size can 
be set using the -p option for paper size, or -w and -l for paper width and 
length, then each page of the TIFF image is centered on its page.  The 
distance unit for default resolution and page width and length can be set 
by the -u option, the default unit is inch.
.PP
Various items of the output document information can be set with the -e, -c, 
-a, -t, -s, and -k tags.  Setting the argument of the option to "" for these 
tags causes the relevant document information field to be not written.  Some 
of the document information values otherwise get their information from the 
input TIFF image, the software, author, document name, and image description.
.PP

Systems, Incorporated.
