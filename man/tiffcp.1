.TH TIFFCP 1 "January 9, 1996"
.SH NAME
tiffcp \- copy (and possibly convert) a
.SM TIFF
file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tiffcp
[
.I options
]
.I "src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tiffcp
combines one or more files created according
to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0
into a single
.SM TIFF
file.
Because the output file may be compressed using a different
algorithm than the input files,
.I tiffcp
is most often used to convert between different compression
schemes.
.PP
By default, 
.I tiffcp
will copy all the understood tags in a
.SM TIFF
directory of an input
file to the associated directory in the output file.
.PP
.I tiffcp
can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data
in a file, but it is explicitly intended to not alter or convert
the image data content in any way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte order.
This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
overwritten and not when it is appended to.
.TP
.B \-C
Suppress the use of ``strip chopping'' when reading images
that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed data.
.TP
.B \-c
Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file:
.B none 
for no compression,
.B packbits
for PackBits compression,
.B lzw
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression,
.B jpeg
for baseline JPEG compression,
.B zip
for Deflate compression,
.B g3
for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
and
.B g4
for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.
By default
.I tiffcp
will compress data according to the value of the
.I Compression
tag found in the source file.
.IP
The
.SM CCITT
Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can only
be used with bilevel data.
.IP
Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
T.4-specific options:
.B 1d
for 1-dimensional encoding,
.B 2d
for 2-dimensional encoding,
and
.B fill
to force each encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the
terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
Group 3-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``g3'' option; e.g.
.B "\-c g3:2d:fill"
to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL codes.
.IP
.SM LZW
compression can be specified together with a 
.I predictor
value.
A predictor value of 2 causes
each scanline of the output image to undergo horizontal
differencing before it is encoded; a value
of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.
LZW-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``lzw'' option; e.g.
.B "\-c lzw:2"
for
.SM LZW
compression with horizontal differencing.
.TP
.B \-f
Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output data.
By default,
.I tiffcp
will create a new file with the same fill order as the original.
Specifying
.B "\-f lsb2msb"
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
.SM LSB2MSB,
while
.B "\-f msb2lsb"
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
.SM MSB2LSB.
.TP
.B \-l
Specify the length of a tile (in pixels).
.I tiffcp
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
.TP
.B \-L
Force output to be written with Little-Endian byte order.
This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
overwritten and not when it is appended to.
.TP
.B \-M
Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading images.
.TP
.B \-p
Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data
that has one 8-bit sample per pixel.
By default,
.I tiffcp
will create a new file with the same planar configuration as
the original.
Specifying
.B "\-p contig"
will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
together, while
.B "\-p separate"
will force samples to be written in separate planes.
.TP
.B \-r
Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data
written to the output file.
By default,
.I tiffcp
attempts to set the rows/strip
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip.
.TP
.B \-s
Force the output file to be written with data organized in strips
(rather than tiles).
.TP
.B \-t
Force the output file to be written wtih data organized in tiles
(rather than strips).
options can be used to force the resultant image to be written
as strips or tiles of data, respectively.
.TP
.B \-w
Specify the width of a tile (in pixels).
.I tiffcp
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following concatenates two files and writes the result using 
.SM LZW
encoding:
.RS
.nf
tiffcp -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif
.fi
.RE
.PP
To convert a G3 1d-encoded 
.SM TIFF
to a single strip of G4-encoded data the following might be used:
.RS
.nf
tiffcp -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif
.fi
.RE
(1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of rows in
the source file.)
