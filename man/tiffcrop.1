.SH NAME
tiffcrop \- copy (and possibly convert and crop or process) a
.SM TIFF
file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tiffcrop
[
.I options
]
.I "src1.tif ... srcN.tif dst.tif"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tiffcrop
combines one or more files created according to the Tag Image File Format,
Revision 6.0 into a single
.SM TIFF
file. The output file may be compressed using a different algorithm than the
input files.
.I tiffcrop
is most often used to extract portions of an image for processing with bar
code recognizer or OCR software when that software cannot restrict the region
of interest to a specific portion of the image or to improve efficiency when
the regions of interest must be rotated.
.PP
By default, 
.I tiffcrop
will copy all the understood tags in a
.SM TIFF
directory of an input file to the associated directory in the output file.
.PP
.I tiffcrop
can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data in a file, and
it will alter or convert the image data content as specified at the same time,
unlike tiffcp.
.PP
.I tiffcrop
will behave exactly like tiffcp if none of the new options are specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-N odd|even|#,#-#,#|last
sequences and ranges of images within file to process. The words
.B odd
or
.B even
may be used to specify all odd or even numbered images. The word
.B last 
may be used in place of a number in the sequence to indicate the final image
in the file without knowing how many images there are. Ranges of images may be
specified with a dash and multiple sets can be indicated by joining them in a
comma-separated list. e.g.. use
.B \-N 1,5-7,last 
to process the 1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.
.TP
.B \-E top|bottom|left|right
use the top, bottom, left, or right edge as origin reference for width and
length of crop regions. May be abbreviated to first letter.
.TP
.B \-U in|cm|px
units to apply to dimensions for margins and crop regions. Inches or
centimeters are converted to pixels using the resolution unit specified in the
TIFF file (which defaults to inches if not specified in the IFD).
.TP
.B \-m #,#,#,#
margins to be removed from the image. The order must be top, left, bottom,
right with only commas separating the elements of the list. Margins are scaled
according to the current units and removed before any other extractions are
computed. Capital M was in use.
.TP
.B \-X #
horizontal (X-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to the specified
origin reference. If the origin is the top or bottom edge, the X axis value
will be assumed to start at the left edge.
.TP
.B \-Y #
vertical (Y-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to the specified
origin reference. If the origin is the left or right edge, the Y axis value
will be assumed to start at the top.
.TP
.B \-Z  #:#,#:#  
zones of the image designated as position X of Y equal sized portions measured
from the reference edge,  e.g. 1:3 would be first third of the image starting
from the reference edge minus any margins specified for the confining edges.
Multiple zones can be specified as a comma separated list but they must
reference the same edge. To extract the top quarter and the bottom third of an
image you would use 
.B \-Z 1:4,3:3.
.TP
.B \-F horiz|vert
flip, i.e. mirror, the image or extracted region horizontally or vertically.
.TP
.B \-R 90|180|270
rotate the image or extracted region 90, 180, or 270 degrees clockwise.
.TP
.B \-I
invert the colorspace values for grayscale and bi-level images. This 
would be used to correct negative images that have incorrect PHOTOMETRIC
INTERPRETATION tags. No support for color images.
.TP
.BI \-b " image"
subtract the following monochrome image from all others processed.  This can
be used to remove a noise bias from a set of images.  This bias image is
typically an image of noise the camera saw with its shutter closed. Bias image
support is not available with options for cropping, rotating, or inverting the
image.
.TP
.B \-B
Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte order. This option only has an
effect when the output file is created or overwritten and not when it is
appended to.
.TP
.B \-C
Suppress the use of ``strip chopping'' when reading images that have a single
strip/tile of uncompressed data.
.TP
.B \-c
Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file:
.B none 
for no compression,
.B packbits
for PackBits compression,
.B lzw
for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression,
.B jpeg
for baseline JPEG compression,
.B zip
for Deflate compression,
.B g3
for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
and
.B g4
for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.
By default
.I tiffcrop
will compress data according to the value of the
.I Compression
tag found in the source file.
.IP
The
.SM CCITT
Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can only
be used with bi-level data.
.IP
Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
T.4-specific options:
.B 1d
for 1-dimensional encoding,
.B 2d
for 2-dimensional encoding,
and
.B fill
to force each encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the
terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
Group 3-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``g3'' option; e.g.
.B "\-c g3:2d:fill"
to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL codes.
.IP
.SM LZW
compression can be specified together with a 
.I predictor
value.
A predictor value of 2 causes
each scanline of the output image to undergo horizontal
differencing before it is encoded; a value
of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.
LZW-specific options are specified by appending a ``:''-separated
list to the ``lzw'' option; e.g.
.B "\-c lzw:2"
for
.SM LZW
compression with horizontal differencing.
.TP
.B \-f
Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output data.
By default,
.I tiffcrop
will create a new file with the same fill order as the original.
Specifying
.B "\-f lsb2msb"
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
.SM LSB2MSB,
while
.B "\-f msb2lsb"
will force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
.SM MSB2LSB.
.TP
.B \-i
Ignore non-fatal read errors and continue processing of the input file.
.TP
.B \-l
Specify the length of a tile (in pixels).
.I tiffcrop
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
.TP
.B \-L
Force output to be written with Little-Endian byte order.
This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
overwritten and not when it is appended to.
.TP
.B \-M
Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading images.
.TP
.B \-p
Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data
that has one 8-bit sample per pixel.
By default,
.I tiffcrop
will create a new file with the same planar configuration as
the original.
Specifying
.B "\-p contig"
will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
together, while
.B "\-p separate"
will force samples to be written in separate planes.
.TP
.B \-r
Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data
written to the output file.
By default (or when value
.B 0
is specified),
.I tiffcrop
attempts to set the rows/strip
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip. If you specify
special value
.B -1
it will results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire image
will be the one strip in that case.
.TP
.B \-s
Force the output file to be written with data organized in strips
(rather than tiles).
.TP
.B \-t
Force the output file to be written with data organized in tiles
(rather than strips).
options can be used to force the resultant image to be written
as strips or tiles of data, respectively.
.TP
.B \-w
Specify the width of a tile (in pixels).
.I tiffcrop
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
.I tiffcrop
attempts to set the tile dimensions so
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
.TP
.B \-,={character}
substitute {character} for ',' in parsing image directory indices
in files.  This is necessary if filenames contain commas.
Note that ',=' with whitespace immediately following will disable
the special meaning of the ',' entirely.  See examples.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following concatenates two files and writes the result using 
.SM LZW
encoding:
.RS
.nf
tiffcrop -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif
.fi
.RE
.PP
To convert a G3 1d-encoded 
.SM TIFF
to a single strip of G4-encoded data the following might be used:
.RS
.nf
tiffcrop -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif
.fi
.RE
(1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of rows in
the source file.)

To extract a selected set of images from a multi-image TIFF file 
use the -N option described above. Thus, to copy the 1st and 3rd
images of image file "album.tif" to "result.tif":
.RS
.nf
tiffcrop -N 1,3 album.tif result.tif
.fi
.RE

Given file "CCD.tif" whose first image is a noise bias
followed by images which include that bias,
subtract the noise from all those images following it
(while decompressing) with the command:
.RS
.nf
tiffcrop -c none -b CCD.tif CCD.tif -d 2 result.tif
.fi
.RE
